# ♻ NFT royalties distribution

## Sol Buttz NFT Royalties distribution

Due to recent changes applied by marketplaces on royalties policy, we had to choose between renounce royalties to allow staking or enforce royalties removing staking from roadmap, at least for initila stage.\
Having always our community in mind, we decided to renounce to royalties in favour of allowing Sol Buttz NFT staking.\
\
Hovewer, also if collection royalties are not enforced by design, we can still collect 5% royalties from some sales of those that choosen to support us.\
All royalties collected through secondary marketplace sales flows automatically into this address: [7ZYXfeib6E1eLKntetgtnN3euWxVEasdwXehndLYTXb3](https://solscan.io/account/7ZYXfeib6E1eLKntetgtnN3euWxVEasdwXehndLYTXb3)\
All Solana held on this address are NET (the artist is already getting his part due to the smart contract share) and wil be redistributed as follow at the end of each month:

* 35% of royalties will be distributed and shared proportionally among all [top 20 NFT holders](https://hyperspace.xyz/collection/4HqRYwwaYGyJB39R96M7tiBfhMuEAMsqoc827m4HQAW6?activeTab=Analytics) (this number can be adjusted as soon as distribution improves) at the end of each month.
* 25% of royalties go towards a “repurchase program” through which we will buyback NFT from floor to create NFT reserves for community raffles purpose or for further re-sale at higher prices.
* 25% of royalties will be held in $SOL and deposited in a dedicated vault address as investment in case $SOL goes up in price, so we can use it towards further development and paying expenses.
* 15% of royalties goes to a fund for paying expenses to hire artists for the creation of artworks for the next collections.

All address where funds will be held will be published soon.

## Holders eligibility for royalties distribution

As described in the previous paragraph, 35% of rall oyalties collected through secondary marketplace will be distributed and shared proportionally among all [top 20 NFT holders](https://hyperspace.xyz/collection/4HqRYwwaYGyJB39R96M7tiBfhMuEAMsqoc827m4HQAW6?activeTab=Analytics)\*, at the end of each month.\
In order to be eligible for royalties distributoin, we count as valid **ONLY** those NFT that are **delisted and staked** at the moment that we take the monthly snapshot, **that could happen randomly, anytime during the month, without prior announcement.**\
\
**Example:**\
****The total of royalties collected are 10 SOL, so the 35% to redistribute to holders is 3.5 SOL\
****Let's suppose that all top 20 holders own a total of 650/1000 NFT.\
**Case A:** You are in this top 20 holders with 50 total NFT.\
At the snapshot you have 46/50 NFT delisted but only 20/46 NFT are staked: we count as valid **only** 20 NFT.\
**Case B:** You are in this top 20 holders with 50 total NFT.\
At the snapshot you have 50/50 NFT delisted and staked: we count as valid **ALL** 50 NFT.\
\
To make the count of how much royalties share you will get we  will use the formula:\
(35% of total royalties) \* (Total NFT eligible for stake/Total NFT owned by all top 20) \* 100\
\
**Case A**: 3,5 SOL \* (20/650)\*100 = 0,107 SOL\
**Case B:** 3,5 SOL \* (50/650)\*100 = 0,23 SOL

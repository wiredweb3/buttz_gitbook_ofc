## Sol Buttz NFT Royalties distribution

Due to recent changes applied by marketplaces on royalties policy, we had to choose between renounce royalties to allow staking or enforce royalties removing staking from roadmap, at least for initial stage.\
Having always our community in mind, we decided to renounce to royalties in favour of allowing Sol Buttz NFT staking.\
\
Hovewer, also if collection royalties are not enforced by design, we can still collect 5% royalties from some sales of those that choosen to support us.\
All royalties collected through secondary marketplace sales flows automatically into this address: [7ZYXfeib6E1eLKntetgtnN3euWxVEasdwXehndLYTXb3](https://solscan.io/account/7ZYXfeib6E1eLKntetgtnN3euWxVEasdwXehndLYTXb3)

* 50% of royalties will be distributed and shared proportionally among **all those that hold at least 5 SOL BUTTZ NFT** at the end of each month.
* 50% of royalties will be held in $SOL and deposited in a dedicated vault address as investment in case $SOL goes up in price, so we can use it towards further development and paying expenses.

## Holders eligibility for royalties distribution

As described in the previous paragraph, 50% of all royalties collected through secondary marketplace will be distributed and shared proportionally among **all those that hold at least 5 SOL BUTTZ NFT.** \
In order to be eligible for royalties distributoin, we count as valid **ONLY** holders that have all their 5 NFT **delisted and staked** at the moment that we take the monthly snapshot, **that could happen randomly, anytime during the month, without prior announcement.**

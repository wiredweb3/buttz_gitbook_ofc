Welcome to **"BUTTZPAY"**, the official Raid to Earn program from Sol Buttz.

## **How it works?**&#x20;

**"BUTTZPAY"** run on the official [Sol Buttz Discord](https://discord.me/buttz) server and have a dedicated channel where the team release different daily tasks. Eligible raiders, wearing an appropriate role, just have to complete tasks proposed by the team to earn payouts.\
\
Once tasks are completed, the team reviews all entries and process all payouts. Payments are issued to users through an internal Discord bot. The amount earned by users (in SOL/BUTTZ/USDC) can be then withdrawn anytime from their internal Discord wallet accounts and deposited in exchange or personal user wallets.\


## **How to join?**

****\
**"BUTTZPAY**" is available only to Discord users with **@ButtzRaider** role. This special role provide access to private tasks channels. To receive the role and access tasks section, **@ButtzRaider** need to hold in their wallet a minimum balance of **$BUTTZ token.**\
The minimum threshold to get and maintain the role is currently 51000000000 $BUTTZ, and increase by 2% every week.\
Once users hold the minimum requested $BUTTZ token amount, is possible to proceed to **Collabland** verification, that automatically assign the **@ButtzRaider** role allowing to access private channels, participate to **BUTTZPAY** raids and receive payouts.

{% hint style="warning" %}

{% endhint %}

## **How to leave BUTTZPAY?**

Users are free to leave and rejoin anytime they want. From the moment that the threshold of $BUTTZ token goes below the requested threshold , the role will be automatically revoked  and access to private channels will be lost.\
In order to regain access, simply obtain the amount requested at the time of the request and proceed on completing Collabland verification again.

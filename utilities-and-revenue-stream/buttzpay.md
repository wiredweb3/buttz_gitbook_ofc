# ðŸ¤‘ BUTTZPAY

Welcome to **"BUTTZPAY"**, the official Raid to Earn program from Sol Buttz.

## **What is it?**

**BUTTZPAY** is designed to maximise the power of the community distributing real money payouts (SOL/BUTTZ/USDC) to all eligible raiders that contribute with their engagement on Discord and Twitter.&#x20;

## **How it works?**&#x20;

**"BUTTZPAY"** run on the official [Sol Buttz Discord](https://discord.me/buttz) server and have a dedicated channel where the team release different daily tasks. Eligible raiders, wearing an appropriate role, just have to complete tasks proposed by the team to earn payouts.\
\
Once tasks are completed, the team reviews all entries and process all payouts. Payments are issued to users through an internal Discord bot. The amount earned by users (in SOL/BUTTZ/USDC) can be then withdrawn anytime from their internal Discord wallet accounts and deposited in exchange or personal user wallets.\


## **How to join?**

****\
**"BUTTZPAY**" is accessible only for Discord users with **@ButtzRaider** role. This special role provide access to private tasks channels where the team release contents to raid. To receive the role and access tasks section, **@ButtzRaider** need to hold in their wallet a minimum balance of **$BUTTZ token.**\
The minimum threshold to get and maintain the role started from 50.000.000.000 $BUTTZ, and increase by 3% every week to create demand for the token.\
Once users hold the minimum requested $BUTTZ token amount, is possible to proceed to **Collab.land** verification, that automatically assign the **@ButtzRaider** role allowing to access private channels, participate to **BUTTZPAY** raids and receive payouts.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Twitter account with lesst than 50 followers or with less than 2 months are not eligible to receive payouts, also if the specific account hold the **@ButtzRaider** role.
{% endhint %}

## **How to leave BUTTZPAY?**

Users are free to leave and rejoin anytime they want. **@ButtzRaider** role will be automatically revoked and access to private channels will be lost once the threshold of $BUTTZ token goes below the requested amount. \
In order to regain access, simply obtain the amount requested at that time and proceed on completing Collab.land verification again.

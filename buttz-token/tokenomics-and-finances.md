## NFT Royalties distribution

* 50% of royalties will be distributed perpetually to the artist as compensation.
* 25% of royalties go towards a ‚Äúrepurchase program‚Äù. We will buyback our secondary floor to create reserves for further re-sale in case should we need more funds, or for raffle NFT to users.
* 10% of royalties stays in $SOL and deposited in a vault as an investment in case $SOL goes up in price, so we can use it towards further development and paying expenses.
* 7% of royalties goes to a fund for paying expenses to hire artists for the creation of artworks for the next collections.&#x20;
* 5% of royalties will be deposited until a legitimate DAO forms with proper governance.&#x20;
* 3% will be distributed and shared proportionally among all holders on each querter according to some (still undisclosed) criteria.

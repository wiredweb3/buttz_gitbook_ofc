# ðŸ“– Sol Buttz & $BUTTZ Ecosystem

This space is where the team publish everything you needs to know about the project, all utilities and futures developments and is designed to be read linearly.\
We recommend reading everything through in one sitting and then revisiting and re-reading if you need to.

For **new project members**, this space will be helpful for a first approach with the team and the project, in order to better learn about what's the project about and what the team is building.

For **long-time  project members**, this space will act as a reminder and allow you to find answers about platforms, utilites, links, procedures and tools used in the ecosystem.
